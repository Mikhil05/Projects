    "### Evaluation Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaggle competition uses **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the performance metric. MAE is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted prices and the actual prices. Unlike RMSE, MAE treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAE** is easy to interpret because it retains the same unit as the target variable (price), making it straightforward to understand the average prediction error in terms of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of MAE is its robustness to outliers. Since it does not square the errors, it is less sensitive to extremely large deviations in price. This makes it a suitable metric for datasets like Airbnb pricing, where high-end luxury listings can introduce skewed price distributions. However, one limitation is that MAE does not penalize large errors as heavily as RMSE would, so it may under-represent the impact of very inaccurate predictions in certain use cases.\n"

    "\n",
    "- The most affected columns are:\n",
    "  - `host_neighbourhood` (49.4%)\n",
    "  - `host_about` (32.4%)\n",
    "  - `neighborhood_overview` and `neighbourhood` (26.0%)\n",

    "  - `room_type`, `property_type`, and `beds` each have ~1% or less missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review scores (e.g., `review_scores_cleanliness`, `review_scores_value`, etc.) all have identical low missingness (~0.31%), likely from listings with no reviews.\n",

    "- Several columns (e.g., `latitude`, `longitude`, `host_name`, `host_verifications`, `availability_*`) have no missing values in either dataset.\n",
    "- The missingness patterns are generally consistent between train and test, which makes our imputation strategies transferable.\n",

    "\n",
    "We examined the central tendency and spread of the numerical features in the training dataset using `describe()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Host and Listing Volume**:\n",
    "  - `host_listings_count` has a wide range from 1 to 292, with a strong right skew (mean = 15.6, median = 3), indicating a small number of hosts with very large portfolios.\n",
    "  - `calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes` and related features show similar right-skewed patterns, with most values near zero and a few extremely high.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accommodation Capacity**:\n",
    "  - `accommodates` ranges from 1 to 16, with a median of 4. This reflects a dominance of listings for small groups or families.\n",
    "  - `bedrooms` and `beds` follow similar patterns, with most listings offering 1–3 bedrooms and 1–4 beds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum and Maximum Nights**:\n",
    "  - `minimum_nights` shows strong skewness, ranging from 1 to 1125 nights. The median is 2, but the max is over 1000 — likely a data artifact or special case.\n",
    "  - `maximum_nights` also spans a wide range from 1 to 10,000, with a mean of 712 but a median of 1125, further confirming the presence of very high outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review Scores**:\n",
    "  - Most review scores are tightly clustered between 4.5 and 5.0, suggesting generally high satisfaction.\n",
    "  - However, the minimum score values go down to 1.0 in all categories, implying a few listings with poor feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review Activity**:\n",
    "  - `reviews_per_month` ranges from 0.01 to 34.1, showing high variance. The median is 1.0, suggesting most listings receive 1–2 reviews monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights highlight the importance of addressing skewness (e.g. via log transformations) and treating outliers in variables like `minimum_nights`, `host_listings_count`, and `reviews_per_month`.\n"

    "- **Observation**: Most listings are priced below **$1,000**, but some outliers exceed **$10,000**, pulling the distribution tail.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `amenities` column was cleaned by removing brackets, quotes, escape characters, and excessive whitespace.\n",
    "- Each listing’s amenities were split into a list (`amenities_list`) and lowercased for consistency.\n",
    "- Empty or short entries were filtered out.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Compute Amenity-Level Price Statistics\n",

    "  - The standard deviation of those prices\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Score Each Amenity Based on Price Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **lift score** was calculated for each amenity by subtracting the global average `log_price` from the amenity’s average.\n",
    "- These were converted into a percentile-based **`amenity_score`** ranging from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Create `amenity_quality_score` for Each Listing\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each listing, the `amenity_quality_score` is the average score of all valid amenities it contains.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `minimum_nights`, `maximum_minimum_nights`, and `minimum_nights_avg_ntm` were grouped into meaningful categories:\n",
    "  - `\"1-night\"`\n",
    "  - `\"Short (2–3)\"`\n",
    "  - `\"Medium (4–7)\"`\n",

    "  - `\"Extended (15+)\"`\n",

    "- A simplified version was also created for average nights:\n",
    "  - `\"Avg 1-night\"`, `\"Avg Short\"`, `\"Avg Medium\"`, `\"Avg Long\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Host Listing Volume: Shared and Private Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms` and `...private_rooms` were binned using custom rules:\n",
    "  - `\"None\"` for 0 listings\n",
    "  - `\"Few\"` (1–2), `\"Some\"` (3–5), and `\"Many\"` (6+)\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the scale of the host's operation in terms of room type availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entire Home Listings Binning\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes` was binned using fixed intervals:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Amenity Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `amenities` column was cleaned by removing special characters, standardising case, and splitting into lists.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- For each amenity appearing in at least 30 listings, we computed the average `log_price` of listings that include it.\n",
    "- Amenities with an average price significantly above the global average (`avg + 0.11`) were labelled as `premium`; others were classified as `basic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Count Amenities by Type\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each listing, we counted:\n",

    "To quantify and categorise host experience, we transformed the `host_since` column into multiple interpretable features:\n",

    "#### Step 1: Extract Time-Based Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- `host_since` was converted into a datetime object (if not already).\n",
    "- From this, we derived:\n",
    "  - `host_days_active`: number of days since the host joined\n",
    "  - `host_years_active`: number of years since joining (days ÷ 365.25)\n",
    "  - `host_start_month`: numeric month of account creation\n",
    "  - `host_start_year`: year of account creation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Binning Host Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on `host_years_active`, we defined experience levels using custom bins:\n",
    "  - `<1 year` → `\"newbie\"`\n",
    "  - `<3 years` → `\"intermediate\"`\n",
    "  - `<6 years` → `\"experienced\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `host_experience_level` was one-hot encoded with `drop_first=True` to prevent multicollinearity.\n",
    "- The original `host_since` column was dropped as its useful information is now captured by derived features.\n",
