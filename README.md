Built and compared multiple machine learning regression models (RidgeCV, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict Airbnb listing prices in Melbourne using structured property features.

Applied rigorous hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RidgeCV, optimizing for mean absolute error with 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation.

Developed an advanced stacked ensemble model integrating Ridge, XGBoost, KNN, CatBoost, and HistGradientBoosting; reduced cross-validated MAE from 0.2812 (Ridge) to 0.2340, boosting accuracy.

Engineered model pipelines with StandardScaler and consistent preprocessing to reduce overfitting and improve reproducibility.

Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), including outlier treatment via Winsorization and feature correlation analysis to inform model selection and scaling.

Achieved top 50 ranking (Rank 48) in Kaggle private leaderboard among course participants, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen test data.
